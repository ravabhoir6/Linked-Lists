## Introduction

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming. They consist of a chain of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node. This repository aims to provide Python programs that illustrate different operations that can be performed on singly linked lists.

## Programs

Here's a list of programs included in this repository:

1. **Insertion at the Beginning**: Program to insert a node at the beginning of a linked list.

2. **Insertion at the End**: Program to insert a node at the end of a linked list.

3. **Insertion at a Specific Position**: Program to insert a node at a specific position within a linked list.

4. **Deletion at a Specific Position**: Program to delete a node from a specific position within a linked list.

5. **Traversal**: Program to traverse and display the elements of a linked list.

Each program is located in its respective directory and comes with a Python script that demonstrates the operation along with a brief explanation.
